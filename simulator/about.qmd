## Measuring Electric Vehicle Owners' Willingness to Enroll in Smart Charging Programs

### About This Study

#### Abstract

<div style="max-width: 120rem;">

As Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) gain popularity, managing their charging becomes crucial for balancing electricity supply and demand on the grid. Smart charging programs can help utilities manage this demand and integrate more renewable energy by controlling when and how BEVs are charged. However, these programs require participation from BEV owners, who may be hesitant to freely provide such control. This study uses a discrete choice experiment (also called conjoint analysis) to measure BEV owners' willingness to participate in smart charging programs under various attributes. We examine two types of smart charging: Supplier-Managed Charging (SMC), which controls charging times, and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), allowing BEVs to return power to the grid. In online surveys through Meta ads and a Dynata survey panel, we collected 1356 responses consisting of demographic and SMC program choice results. The optional V2G section has 682 sets of results. We used multinomial logit (MNL) models to quantify the willingness of respondents to participate in these programs. The findings indicate a general reluctance to participate in both programs without some form of incentive, with respondents being most sensitive to regular (monthly) monetary incentives. For SMC, there is also concern about ensuring sufficient battery charge levels in the mornings. Simulations were conducted to predict enrollment rates based on different program attributes.

### About This Simulator

<div style="max-width: 120rem;">

We generated the MNL (Multinomial Logit) models of SMC and V2G programs using the responses (N = 1356) collected from the conjoint survey. Using this model, along with the `logitr` package made by Dr John Helveston, we can simulate the enrollment rate of SMC and V2G programs under different scenarios.

In section 4.3 of the paper, we did 4 scenarios for both programs and illustrated their enrollment rates in bar charts. This provides a general idea of how the enrollment rate will change under different scenarios, and how these scenarios are prioritized by BEV owners. From these 4 scenarios, we found BEV owners value *Guaranteed Threshold* of their battery the most in SMC, and recurring monetary incentives (consisting *Occurrence Cash* and *Monthly Occurrence*) the most in V2G.

Then, in section 5, we did exemplar SMC and V2G program designs to showcase a reasonable trade-off technique with limited budgets, maximizing the efficiency of the most influential attributes.

Both the 4 scenarios and the exemplar program designs are generated by the prediction function from `logitr` based on the MNL models. Therefore, we embedded this prediction algorithm into this simulator, so that users can adjust each attribute to generate expected enrollment rates in real-time.

In this simulator, the SMC and V2G programs are in different tabs. They both start from a pre-defined baseline. Feel free to play with different combinations and see how they influence the enrollment rates.
