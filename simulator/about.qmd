## Grid-Integration of Electric Vehicles: Consumer Preferences for Supplier Managed Charging and Vehicle-to-Grid Programs

### About This Study

#### Abstract

<div style="max-width: 120rem;">

As power systems transition toward renewable energy sources, integrating Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) into grid operations becomes crucial for optimizing energy resources and enabling multi-energy sector coupling. Smart charging programs can help utilities balance electricity supply and demand while facilitating renewable energy integration, but their success depends on BEV owner participation. This study examines two grid-integration strategies: Supplier-Managed Charging (SMC), which enables utilities to optimize charging timing and duration, and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), which transforms BEVs into distributed energy storage resources that can support grid stability. Using a discrete choice experiment with 1,356 current BEV owners, recruited through social media advertisements and survey panels, we quantify how different program attributes influence enrollment decisions. Our multinomial logit models reveal distinct preference patterns that inform program design: SMC participants predominantly value operational flexibility and recurring payments, while V2G participants show stronger preferences for monetary incentives, indicating willingness to provide grid services for compensation. Through simulation analysis, we identify program ``attribute equivalencies’’ that quantify the changes needed in program attributes to achieve equivalent enrollment levels, offering utilities guidance for designing grid-integration programs that balance system needs with consumer preferences. These findings offer insights for developing market mechanisms and policy frameworks that can accelerate the integration of BEVs into future energy systems while supporting power system decarbonization.

### About This Simulator

<div style="max-width: 120rem;">

We generated the MNL (Multinomial Logit) models of SMC and V2G programs using the responses (N = 1356) collected from the conjoint survey. Using this model, along with the `logitr` package made by Dr John Helveston, we can simulate the enrollment rate of SMC and V2G programs under different scenarios.

In section 4.3 of the paper, we did 4 scenarios for both programs and illustrated their enrollment rates in bar charts. This provides a general idea of how the enrollment rate will change under different scenarios, and how these scenarios are prioritized by BEV owners. From these 4 scenarios, we found BEV owners value *Guaranteed Threshold* of their battery the most in SMC, and recurring monetary incentives (consisting *Occurrence Cash* and *Monthly Occurrence*) the most in V2G.

Then, in section 5, we did exemplar SMC and V2G program designs to showcase a reasonable trade-off technique with limited budgets, maximizing the efficiency of the most influential attributes.

Both the 4 scenarios and the exemplar program designs are generated by the prediction function from `logitr` based on the MNL models. Therefore, we embedded this prediction algorithm into this simulator, so that users can adjust each attribute to generate expected enrollment rates in real-time.

In this simulator, the SMC and V2G programs are in different tabs. They both start from a pre-defined baseline. Feel free to play with different combinations and see how they influence the enrollment rates.
